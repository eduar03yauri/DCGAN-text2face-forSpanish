# Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Synthesis & Generation: A Comparative Analysis of Natural Language Processing models for the Spanish language
This repository contains the code, models and corpus of the project "Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Synthesis &
Generation: A Comparative Analysis of Natural Language
Processing models for the Spanish language". This paper develops a study to generate images of faces from a textual description in Spanish. A cDCGAN was used as a generator, and a comparison of the RoBERTa-large-bne, RoBERTa -large-bne-celebAEs-UNI (our model) and Sent2vec The last two models were trained using a Spanish descriptive corpus of the CelebA image dataset.
